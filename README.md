# Boutique Hotel Yield Management: Demand Modeling + Price Optimization

A compact, end-to-end analytics project that demonstrates how yield management teams can translate customer behavior data into a **profit-maximizing price recommendation**. 
The workflow combines (1) **conversion / acceptance modeling**, (2) **auxiliary revenue modeling**, and (3) an **optimization layer** that selects the best single price under realistic business assumptions.

## Why this project matters

Yield management (pricing + promotion decision-making) sits at the intersection of:
- **Customer response** to price (conversion, retention/churn, engagement)
- **Unit economics** (variable cost, contribution margin)
- **Decision optimization** (choosing the price/promo that maximizes profit)

This project demonstrates the core “Pricing & Yield Management” toolkit using a controlled dataset and a transparent methodology.

## Project objective

Recommend a **single standardized price** that maximizes expected profit by modeling:

1. **Probability of acceptance** as a function of quoted price and request attributes  
2. **Auxiliary revenue** as a function of stay/request characteristics  
3. **Expected profit** as a function of price, variable costs, and auxiliary revenue margin

## Key outputs

- Estimated price-response curve (conversion vs. price)
- Drivers of auxiliary revenue
- Profit curve across candidate prices
- Recommended price with sensitivity analysis (e.g., margin assumptions, cost per unit)
